There are six, and One. The god above who showed Prophet Erebius his light showed us six faces: Anu, the father of light, Ahros the Judge, Velhu the merciful, Sid the compassionate, and Pythion, the Redeemer who was redeemed.

How can there be both six and one?

Of Course, your mother. What a tragedy, to be overcome with sickness at such an innocent age. I will of course preform the benediction, thank you for summoning me.
